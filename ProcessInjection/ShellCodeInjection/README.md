## Process Injection

Process Injection is a versatile technique that adversaries leverage to perform a wide range of malicious activity. Itâ€™s so versatile that ATT&CK includes 12 sub-techniques of Process Injection. Adversaries perform process injection because it allows them to execute malicious activity by proxy through processes that either have information of value (e.g., lsass.exe) or that blend in with benign operating system activity.
